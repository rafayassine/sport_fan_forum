# Sport Fan Forum

This is a simple forum app like Hacker News where the user can log in,
create,edit or delete post,view them and post comments.
Only the users logged in can create, delete or edit their post and comments.
This app is written using Rails, Html and Sass.

Some of the gems I used :
* devise
* pg
* rails12factor
* simple_form
* bootstrap-sass

You can find a live app [here](https://afternoon-chamber-23412.herokuapp.com/).
You can create a new user or use this credentials to log in :
* email : user@example.com
* password : foobarfoobar
